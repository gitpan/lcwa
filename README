  lcwa -- Last Changes Web Agent

  Version 1.0.4 (03-09-1997)

  LCWA is a web agent which determines the last changes time of documents in
  an Intranet's webcluster by crawling in a fast way through its webareas via
  HTTP.  It was written with speed in mind, so it uses a variable number of
  pre-forked crawling clients which work in parallel.  They are coordinated
  via a server which implements a shared URL stack and a common result pool.
  Each client first pops off an URL from the stack, retrieves the document,
  determines its last changes time and then sends it back to the result pool.
  Additionally if the currently fetched document is of type HTML, it parses
  out all hyperlinks it contains and pushes these back to the shared stack, so
  they can be processed the next time by itself or the other clients.
